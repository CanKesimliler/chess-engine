# chess-engine
It is my first big project in C. I will learn basics of chess computing and polish my ability to code in C via this project

# Work In Progress list
- Generation of pseudo attacks in the engine and the integration of it in the actual game 


# Notes for the future me
- Further optimize generate_queen moves by actually writing the code than calling two functions and make the functions inline after  


# Updates from the last time
1 - renamed the files to make it more understandable  
2 - Abstracted datas both in the engine and the game using different structures  
3 - fixed the bugs regarding the new init functions which are based on bitboards which allows the use of fen data
